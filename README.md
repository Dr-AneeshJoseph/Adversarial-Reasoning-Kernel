## 💀 Core Identity

**Promptware developed by Dr. Aneesh Joseph.**

The **Lateral Synthesis Protocol (LSP)** is a **Context-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** simulation designed to stress-test ideas, kill weak premises, and force "Antifragile" solutions.

## ⚙️ The Architecture (v9.1)

LSP v9.1 improves upon v9.0 with two critical patches:

1.  **The Zealot Patch (Incentive Filter Update):** Previous versions assumed all actors were rational/selfish. v9.1 accounts for **Ideological Actors** (Zealots) who act against their own self-interest, making the "Kill Chain" more robust against political or religious volatility.
2.  **The State Vector (Memory Reinforcement):** Added **Phase 4** to the output. The AI now explicitly writes down the "Active Constraints" at the bottom of every message, ensuring it doesn't forget context (e.g., location, budget) during long conversations.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Zero Trust Generation:** The AI assumes its first thought is wrong.
* **Logic-as-Code:** The AI "thinks" in Python pseudo-code to enforce variable definitions.
* **Context Retention:** Phase 0 & Phase 4 work together to prevent "Context Drift."
* **Pre-Mortem Analysis:** Automatically simulates future failure states.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  Open the `system_instruction.md` file.
2.  Copy the raw text.
3.  Paste it into your AI's **System Prompt** (Claude/Gemini) or **Custom Instructions** (ChatGPT).
4.  Start a new chat.
