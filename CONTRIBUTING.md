## Reporting Security Issues
This is a Dual-Use defense tool. If you find a "Jailbreak" that allows the AI to generate **Actionable Kinetic Harm instructions** (e.g., bomb-making), **DO NOT OPEN A GITHUB ISSUE.**
* Email the Architect directly.
* We treat these as Critical Patches.

## Suggesting Features
We accept Pull Requests for:
1.  New "Doctrinal Filters" (e.g., adding a specific cybersecurity framework).
2.  Optimizations for non-Gemini models (e.g., Claude compatibility).
